This repositary contains soure code and documentation for the Coding assistance application powered by CodeLlama LLAMA2 Large Language Model.

This innovative tool is designed to assist developers by providing real-time code generation, completion, and debugging assistance.
Upon receiving a prompt from the user, the application appends it to the interaction history, allowing for contextually relevant suggestions from the model. By analyzing this history, the model generates accurate and helpful completions or suggestions tailored to the user's programming task.
Furthermore, the interaction history aids in the debugging process by providing context for identifying and fixing errors. Future updates may enhance debugging capabilities with features such as error message analysis and code validation, ensuring even more effective assistance in debugging tasks.
